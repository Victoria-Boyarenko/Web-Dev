<!-- The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. 
It can also be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the 
specific class name. In the following example we have three <div> elements with 
a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will 
be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section: -->
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html> 

<!-- In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class 
attribute with the value of "note". Both <span> elements will be styled
equally according to the .note style definition in the head section: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.note {
  font-size: 120%;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
<p>This is some <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name.
Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- HTML elements can belong to more than one class. To define multiple classes, separate 
the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled 
according to all the classes specified. In the following example, the first <h2> element 
belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from 
both of the classes: -->
<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

<!-- Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.
In the following example, both <h2> and <p> point to the "city" 
class and will share the same style: -->
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p class="city">Paris is the capital of France</p>
